Date Tracker is an app that allows you to track your dates throughout the year so you can explore your dating patterns.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Dating thes days is quite exhausting so if you have an app that allows you to show your dating patterns it could help you avoid the wrong person. Looking back at your dating history can also be fun if you don't tak your dating life seriously.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

The market for my app are those who are actively dating or those who enjoy chaos. The main idea for this app stemmed from tiktok users who have made powerpoint presentations on their dating lives. With an app you can skip the step of using a google spreadsheet and have something thats easily accessible to track any horror stories.
